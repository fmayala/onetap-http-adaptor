# onetap-http-adaptor

now you can stop saying http requests are iMpOssIbLe

## disclaimer

poorly made, you could easily improve this

## usage

use the http api in [/api](/api) folder. you need to use a transpiler like babel to generate compatible code with onetap

start using `node src/index`

<sup>i'm not helping you use this, this is for reference</sup>
